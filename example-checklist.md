# Digital Accessibility Checklist
## Page Organization
Organization includes semantic structure. 
- [ ] Page has a unique, clear, and descriptive page title.
- [ ] Page content is provided in a logical reading order and logical flow (layout).
- [ ] Navigation is consistent across all site pages.
- [ ] Section headings are present.
- [ ] Headings are used sequentially and logically.
- [ ] Digital content pages/documents use heading 1 (h1) only once (per web page or per document).
- [ ] Lists are created and structured as bulleted/numbered lists. 
- [ ] Content is created using built-in styling options when using content authoring tools/rich-text editors. 

## Usability
Usability includes creating a way for users to easily achieve their objectives through your content. 
### Readability
- [ ] Fonts are easy to read (e.g., Arial or Times New Roman).
- [ ] Text is sized for legibility (minimum 12-14 pt for body text).
- [ ] Text is concise and easy to understand. Learn more about the Federal plain language guidelines.
- [ ] Text styling (boldface type, italics, color) are not the only means to convey meaning.
- [ ] Hashtags are written in camel case (the first letter of each word in a hashtag is capitalized).
- [ ] There is sufficient contrast between text and background color.
- [ ] The site’s language is defined (lang attribute).
- [ ] Tables are used to organize tabular data, and are not used for decorative purposes.
- [ ] Link text clearly describes the destination. 
- [ ] Linked text is easy to find. 
- [ ] The communication of information does not rely on color perception.
### Navigation and Control
- [ ] Navigation is possible using the keyboard/without a mouse. 
- [ ] Navigation is free of keyboard traps (e.g., interactive elements taking keyboard focus and preventing navigation to next element).
- [ ] Users are able to determine where they are in the content structure at all times.
- [ ] Controls are provided to the user in order to manage moving, blinking or scrolling content (e.g. - carousels, slide shows).
- [ ] Active controls and links have a clear and visible indication of focus.
- [ ] Form components have meaningful labels. Labels should describe what data is associated with the form element and help everyone to understand what is required to complete the form input.
- [ ] Folder structure is consistent.
- [ ] File names are not confusing (e.g., do not include a long string of numbers/letters).

## Media 
Media includes ensuring that your images, video, and audio are created to allow alternate ways to access.
### Images
- [ ] A suitable text alternative (alt-text) is used to describe images that convey meaning.
- [ ] Alt-text is empty/set to null (alt=””) for images that do not convey meaning.
### Video & Audio

- [ ] Audio recordings have transcripts.
- [ ] Synchronized captions and audio transcripts including the following characteristics.
  - [ ] Everything spoken is shown.
  - [ ] Sounds are announced (e.g., [applause]).
  - [ ] Change of speaker is noted.
  - [ ] Punctuation is present.
- [ ] Captions generated through auto-captioning tools (available through NYU Stream and YouTube) are edited manually for accuracy, to comply to the aforementioned list of caption/transcript characteristics, and to remove timestamps.
