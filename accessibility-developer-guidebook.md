# Digital Accessibility Guidebook
While conversation around accessibility and disabilities started in the United States has started over two centuries ago, the emergence of digital and electronic communication has shaped the dialogue of accessibility today to include Digital Accessibility. Digital accessibility is the practice of making websites, web applications and digital content can be used for for communities with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight or cognitive abilities. The purpose of providing digital accessibility is to allow for digital communication to be a more equitable experience for all. There are many organizations working to standardize the practice of digital access with the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ "W3C WAI website") creating an international set of recommendations, [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/ "WCAG website"). While WCAG offers a comprehensive checklist to test for digital accessibility this guidebook presents some "quick and dirty" tests and solutions get your website to the minimum accessibility requirement.

## Audit
An accessibility audit provides a detailed assessment of your website to identify improvements essential to creating an accessible web page. There are automated testing tools that can programmatically analyze web pages for errors in code, formatting, and color, however, many accessibility concerns can not be determined with these tools and must be manually tested.

### Automated Testing
These automated testing tools will analyze the code of your website and look for programmatic errors such as missing alt text, header structure, and automated color testing.
